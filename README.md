==================

Starter kit for converting hand-drawn maps to tile-based MapBox maps

`tile-map-template.svg` is an svg file intended to be used with Inkscape. It includes a layer of transparent rectangles useful for cutting your map illustration into 256px x 256px PNG "tiles".

`inkscapetombtiles.sh` is a simple shell script that assembles a group of 256px x 256px PNG images into a .MBTiles file.
